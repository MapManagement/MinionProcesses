# Minion Processes
I decided to split [Minion](https://github.com/MapManagement/Minion) in two 
separate repositories. This repository only contains the pure logic of
interacting with KVM/QEMU guests. The other repository includes a GUI
application and a CLI implementation of all processes that have been developed
within this project.
